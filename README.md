# FIFO:
FIFO Stands for First In First Out and It is a very popular and useful design block for purpose of synchronization and a handshaking mechanism between the modules.
## Types of FIFO:
### 1.Synchronous FIFO:
Here data read and write operations use the same clock frequency. Usually, they are used with high clock frequency to support high-speed systems
### 2.Asynchronous FIFO:
Here data read and write operations use the same clock frequency. Usually, they are used for clock domain crossing (CDC) which means it is used in systems where data need to pass from one clock domain to another.
